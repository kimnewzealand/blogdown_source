I have explored different ways of learning how to code and how to use different tools for statistics and data science. I believe the best way to learn is to experiment, practice and share these skills and knowledge.

I live in Auckland, New Zealand and regularly attend meetups and conferences and I am the organiser of R-Ladies Auckland.

I work as an independent through validly and am available for remote data science work.

My areas of specialisation are visualisations, time series and machine learning.
