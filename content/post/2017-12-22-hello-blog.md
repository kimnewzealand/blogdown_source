Welcome to my personal blog of my data science journey. 

Until now I had been creating and publishing R code to github, but I realised I needed another medium to publish html output and interactive plots. 

In setting up this blog using blogdown R package and Hugo, I used the fantastic [tutorial](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) by Tyler Clavelle.

I have also started using GitKraken which has changed my world.
