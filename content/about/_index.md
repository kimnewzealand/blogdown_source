### Background

I discovered data science as a magical field that combines my statistics and analytical skills; my project and multitasking experience; a curiosity of numbers and patterns; love of learning new tools and concepts whilst working with a variety of people and teams.

### Current areas of interest:

+ Interactive [visualisations in R](http://www.validly.co/) and [JavaScript and D3](https://observablehq.com/@kimnewzealand/)
+ Time series in R  
+ NLP in R  
+ Machine learning in R, Python

### Other Professional Activities

I founded the [Auckland chapter](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/) of R-Ladies in November 2017 after attending the R-Ladies Melbourne meetup in October 2017.

I also founded and organised the first [satRdays conference in Auckland](https://auckland2020.satrdays.org/) on 22 February 2020.

### Manifesto for Data Practices

I have signed the [Manifesto for Data Practices](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/). These values and principles, taken together, describe the most effective, ethical, and modern approach to data teamwork.
