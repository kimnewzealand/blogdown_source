### Background

I have a background in Actuarial Science and have worked in analyst roles and project delivery in Credit Risk and Finance. I discovered data science as a magical field that combines my statistics and analytical skills; my project and multitasking experience; a curiosity of numbers and patterns; love of learning new tools and concepts whilst working with a variety of people and teams.

### Current Role

I now work as an independent through [Validly](http://www.validly.co/) and am available for remote data science work.

Current areas of interest for professional development:  

+ Interactive visualisations in R and JavaScript  
+ Time series in R  
+ Machine learning in R, Python, Keras, Golang and H2O

### Other Professional Activities

I regularly attend meetups, workshops and data science conferences.

I also founded the Auckland chapter of R-Ladies in November 2017 after attending the R-Ladies Melbourne meetup in October 2017.

### Manifesto for Data Practices

I have signed the [Manifesto for Data Practices](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/). These values and principles, taken together, describe the most effective, ethical, and modern approach to data teamwork.
