*27 February 2020*  

The first [satrdays conference](https://satrdays.org/) was held in Auckland, New Zealand on 22 February 2020. This blog is about the organisation behind the event and some of the takeaways from an organiser perspective. 

# Motivation for a satRdays conference in New Zealand

I was inspired to "throw" a satRdays in New Zealand after speaking to the [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/thestephlocke) after she presented a workshop at [R-Ladies Auckland](https://twitter.com/rladiesakl). In New Zealand we didn't yet have a data science related community conference that bridged and connected academia and industry.  This event also seemed like a good complement to the existing R-Ladies meetup to promote diversity in the R community. I come from a self taught, slightly non-traditional data science background, so I personally wanted to see more people, especially underrepresented, feel confident to learn R and share this knowledge in a community. 


# The process of organising this event


When it came to organising the event we ran lean, remotely and sometimes we were just winging it. [Earo Wang](https://twitter.com/earowang) joined me as a co-organiser after a quick chat an R-Ladies event. She was in the process of moving cities from Melbourne to Auckland to join the Statistics Department at the University and arrived 16 days days before the conference. We didn't have a fully fledged committee and we only did things that we thought needed to be done first time round, rather than doing all the things on a potential conference wish list. 



In the early stages of organising the conference, we were offered a free venue by the [Statistics Department at the University of Auckland](https://twitter.com/statsauckuni). This enabled us to lock in a date in the satRdays calendar and kick start the real momentum for the event. We sent requests to [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/about/) and [RConsortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program), both of whom have sponsored other satRdays, for financial sponsorship. Apart from these sponsors, we decided not to pursue other corporate or entity sponsorship for the first event in order to set up a conference with community and open source values from the outset. 

These budgetary decisions did mean that we charged for tickets at what we hoped was a reasonable $60. We could then provide free tickets to the volunteers, a number of students and the speakers and so provide coffees, morning and afternoon tea cookies and a brown bag lunch for all attendees. The catering set up outside the room was intentional to facilitate networking and conversations at the intervals.

We chose not to use lanyards as name tags as Earo had large collection already, and used plastic name tags with a clip and pin for different clothing types. We could then collect the name tags and reuse them across future meetup groups and conferences.

My brother, [Neil Fitter](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/neilfitter) redesigned the generic satRday logo with fern and a [koru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koru). This was done just in time to get printed hex stickers.  The stickers were the only minimalist, low waste, conference swag.  We did however print T-shirts, for the volunteers at the event, to help attendees identify volunteers.

During the sessions, we chose to use www.sli.do for the speakers to moderate the Q&A. We hoped that this would engage the audience and inspire quieter voices to have a shared platform with the more confident question askers. 

## The speakers at the event

One of the main differences between other satRdays and our conference is the geographical location of New Zealand.  Our budget was very small and did not extend to cover any travel costs of international speakers. However we were very fortunate to have [JJ Allaire](https://twitter.com/fly_upside_down), the founder and CEO of RStudio do the keynote, **Open Source Software for Data Science** while he was on a family holiday in New Zealand.

We set a limit of 200 attendees because that that was the limit of the room booking. And since we had one room we had a single track of sequential speakers. We wanted to attract a variety of people so we set up four sessions applications of R, graphics, teaching and Production/Infrastructure, each session proceeded with a a local invited speaker. 

For the applications of R we invited [Jacquie Tran](https://twitter.com/jacquietran) who spoke about **Data practices and data problems in performance sport**.

For graphics we invited [Harkanwal Singh](https://twitter.com/kamal_hothi) who presented **The craft of data storytelling**.

The teaching session was invited speaker, [Anna Fergusson](https://twitter.com/annafergussonnz), talking about **Five ways to make learnr even better for teaching**.

Then the production/infrastructure invited speaker was [Simon Urbanek](https://urbanek.info/) talking about **Scalable Collaborative Data Science using R**.

We then set up a Sessionize link to call for speakers to either submit contributed talks or lightning talks.  Having never run a call for speakers before it was interesting to see who applied, and how lightning talks that seem like a seemingly easy introduction to speaking, were very under subscribed.


Profiles of the speakers and the schedule are available on the [website](https://auckland2020.satrdays.org/).

## Event measures of success

We did succeed in throwing a conference and we have some statistics, however the impact of these events are often intangible. Once we have facilitated the event, on the actual event date it is the attendees that make the conference in terms of presentation content, networking or opportunities that unfold.

In summary here are the conference stats for 2020:

+ 1 keynote
+ 4 invited speakers
+ 5 lightning talks
+ 10 contributed talks
+ 70 attendees and 100% turn out
+ 5 free student tickets, and free tickets for speakers and volunteers
+ 1 free intro to R mini workshop on the Friday
+ Conference ticket full price $60
  
## Organiser take aways

Finally there are some take aways from the first satRdays conference:

+ Diversity is an ongoing effort in a community, and while gender diversity is important, it is a wider issue that needs thought and consideration.  
+ We already have amazing and inspiring speakers in the R community but communication is an essential skill for anyone who works with data.  We need to promote,  encouraging and mentor new speakers to apply for speaking opportunities so that we keep the pool of speakers growing.
