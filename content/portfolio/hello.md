Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio of my data science journey.

Until now I have been creating and publishing R code to github and HTML to RPubs. I also have a Wordpress [professional website](http://www.validly.co/) to reach out to both technical and non-technical audiences with summaries of projects. I realised I needed another more personalised medium to publish the detailed code and HTML from projects so I created this blog.

I used the fantastic [tutorial](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) by Tyler Clavelle to create this blog. This blog uses [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package and static site generator Hugo. I chose to use the Hugo creative portfolio theme, with side bar layout.

I have also transitioned from command line Git Bash to using a git client GitKraken and yes I am now [happy with git](http://happygitwithr.com/).
